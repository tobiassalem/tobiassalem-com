				<h2 id="alienation">Alienation</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Aim:</strong> To study and explore the concept of alienation, which can come in many forms. It can be
					self-chosen in a certain situation and phase in life. Or it can be forced upon you by the current surrounding and
					social climate.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Method:</strong> This is done by contemplation on experiences and simply by sketching in different
					materials.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Questions:</strong> What causes someone to choose alienation by free will; and what causes a group to
					freeze someone out? For both situations, what what are the group dynamics that lies behind it? What social
					repercussions does it entail?

				<h2 id="asian">Asian Design</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Aim:</strong> To study, explore and try to capture the asian (here foremost chinese and japanese) spirit in
					form and design in a practical object. The object in this case is a wall mounted console, to which I added a
					natural light source.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Method:</strong> This is done partly through study of Asian culture -both historical and contemporary- such
					as architecture, art, ceramics, origami, martial art and related expressions. And partly through experiments in
					sketching and different materials. I here worked with the study of Asian culture -both historical and contemporary-
					such as architecture, art, ceramics, origami, martial art and related expressions, and continued through
					experiments in sketching and different materials.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Questions:</strong> stretch and push the lines, where does the form begin and end to express the asian
					spirit? how much is needed, and how much can be taken away? Do some forms express it better than others, and if so,
					what are the reasons for this?

				<h2 id="inmotion">In Motion</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Aim:</strong> The objective of this project was to explore the feeling of motion in different forms, and
					attempt to describe it in metal.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Method:</strong> My creative process involved researching all types of movement I could think of, while
					continuously considering what characteristics make us feel that motion. A number of techniques can be involved in
					this. The form and position of the shape based on our knowledge and expectations, classical speed lines which
					indicate fast motion, depiction of recent position of a person or object which different weight depending on how
					far back in time it occurred. In my experience it often boils down to some form of imbalance; a person running, a
					tree falling, a building collapsing, simply a form which by the natural laws could not exist in that position for a
					longer period of time.

				<h2 id="lightbearer">Light Bearer</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Aim:</strong> Part one, find a textile object and explore the form and characteristics, without any
					knowledge or preconceptions about any future use or creation. Build up sketching material solely with the textile
					object as the starting point. Part two, Given the sketching material created and gathered in the project for
					exploration of textile object, design and construct a light bearer. It does not have to be classic candlestand, it
					just needs to have a relation to the candle in any form.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Method:</strong> From selecting a 1930's style hat, researching the forms and features in an unbiased
					exploraty fashion. I here worked in a range of materials including wood, cardboard, paper, sheet metal, metal
					wires, processing them by carving, burning, bending and hammering. I strived towards combining aesthetics with my
					feelings for the concept to be able to reach a suitable design.
